Submitting Patches
------------------
We're open source, and patches are always welcome!
You can send patches by using these commands:

    cd <project>
    <make edits>
    git add -A
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push ssh://<username>@review.androidarmv6.org:29418/<project> HEAD:refs/for/<branch>

Register at review.androidarmv6.org and use the username that you registered there in the above command

Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commit using this command: git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>

If you are going to make extra additions, just repeat steps (Don't start a new patch), but instead of git commit -m
use git commit --amend. Gerrit will recognize it as a new patchset.

To view the status of your and others patches, visit [OMNIROM ARMv6 Code Review](http://review.androidarmv6.org)


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with OMNI ROM, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the OMNI trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/omniarmv6/android.git -b android-4.4

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Then to build:

     cd <source-dir>; . build/envsetup.sh; brunch <device_name>
